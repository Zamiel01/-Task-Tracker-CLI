🧭 Task Tracker CLI

A simple and lightweight Command Line Interface (CLI) application to help you track your daily tasks — add, update, delete, and list them efficiently.
All tasks are stored in a local task.json file, so your data is persistent across sessions.

📦 Features

✅ Add new tasks with description and status

✅ Update existing task descriptions

✅ Update the status of a task (todo, in-progress, done)

✅ Delete tasks by ID

✅ View all tasks

✅ Filter tasks by their status

⚙️ Requirements

Python 3.8 or higher

No external dependencies (uses only Python’s standard library)

🚀 Installation

Clone the repository or download the script:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-tracker-cli.git
cd task-tracker-cli


Run the Python file:

python task_tracker.py


💡 The script automatically creates a task.json file if it doesn’t exist.

🧠 Data Storage

All tasks are stored in a file named task.json in the same directory as the script.

Example structure:

[
  {
    "id": "d3f9b1b8-54d9-4dc7-b6ef-85d6c91c74df",
    "description": "Complete Python CLI app",
    "status": "in-progress",
    "CreatedAt": "2025-10-27 09:30:12",
    "UpdatedAt": "2025-10-27 09:45:00"
  }
]

🧾 Notes

Each task is assigned a unique UUID automatically.

You can manually open and edit task.json if needed.

Make sure to use valid statuses: todo, in-progress, or done.
